# SoundRad

A radically simpler & faster SoundCloud player

http://soundrad.com 

## Built with [Basscss](http://basscss.com) and [Angular](http://angularjs.org)

## Built for speed

With around a **200 Speed Index** on repeat view,
SoundRad is significantly faster than SoundCloud.

### First View

Start Render      | 2.895s     | 1.294s
Speed Index       | 4345       | 1559

### Repeat View

Because SoundRad is built with Angular, it really wins on repeat views.
For fun, you can check out this test of soundcloud.com with absurdly bad results:

## How is it so much faster?
SoundRad focuses on content â€“ in this case, audio.

### No images
SoundCloud loads separate images for each track cover.
It also loads every avatar for every comment on the page.

### No comments
Have you ever actually read a SoundCloud comment?

### Fewer network requests
With SoundCloud, I typically see anywhere from 500 to 1,000 network requests on initial load.
SoundRad keeps it under 20.

## Content-Centric
I use SoundCloud to listen to music. SoundRad focuses on loading audio above all else.
